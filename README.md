# F# Fundamentals
This project serves as a showcase for the fundamental concepts and syntax rules of F#. F# is a functional-first programming language that allows developers to write concise, expressive, and high-performance code.
This is a basic console application that allows the user the following actions: deposit, withdraw and exit. Each transaction has logs in console what happens.

## Features
The following concepts are demonstrated in this project:

- Immutability: F# emphasizes immutability and data transformation, rather than state mutation.
- Pattern Matching: F# offers powerful pattern matching capabilities that enable developers to write concise and expressive code.
- Type Inference: F# has a sophisticated type inference engine that allows developers to write code without explicitly defining types.
- Computation Expressions: F# offers computation expressions, which enable developers to define custom workflows and control flows in a concise and readable manner.
- Function Composition: F# encourages function composition and offers operators such as |> and <| that enable developers to write expressive pipelines.
- Basic use of Railway pattern.
